              reading posts written by kids my age. Soon I started writing my

              an eCommerce site with my friends to sell shirts we designed. I
              didn&apos;t know at the time that what I was doing could be a

              lived in. It felt like serendipity. I replied to the job posting
              and was invited to come into the office. After hearing more about
              the role, I asked how I could join the program. The application
              process was to build an unbeatable Tic-Tac-Toe game. Up until this
              point, I had written mostly HTML/CSS and a little bit of PHP.
